# About Bee & Bee

'Bee & Bee' is a full-stack web application inspired by Airbnb. It is designed to mimic the functionality of Airbnb in terms of hosting creating fictitious 'spots', which people may reserve, add reviews to, and rate.

Please view this repository's wiki page in order to learn more about the functionality of this app. 

This project is built with:
Javascript
React
Redux
Express
Sequelize
SQL-ite

## Features and Design

This project was required to be viewed on a 1024 pixel screen, and it is recommended that potential users do so. The design is based on Airbnb's own layout, and styling was done 'from scratch' using CSS without the use of any libraries. The functionality does not entirely compare to Airbnb, but Bee & Bee does have various features that are explained in-depth in the wiki of this repository. Visual comparisons are available between 'Bee & Bee' and Airbnb as a guide.
